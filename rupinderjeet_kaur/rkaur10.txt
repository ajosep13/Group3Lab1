<p>The Purpose Of Life Is Not Happiness</p>

<p>We prefer doing things that make us happy. From going on holiday to buying a new car, we keep chasing that next nugget of happiness.</p>

<p>If you change it up and look at happiness as being a byproduct of your actions, choices and decisions that involve working towards a larger purpose, you will begin to notice how wonderful life really can be. True happiness is derived from moments of interaction and connection.</p>

<p>I am happiest when doing something useful for somebody else, whether it be a friend, family member, colleague or even a stranger. When I have done something valuable for them, they are happy which makes me happy!</p>

<p>Find something useful to do for someone. Do it. Let me know how you feel afterwards.</p>
